# FlaskAPI

Python dependencies are stored in `requirements.txt`
once dependencies and virtual environment are set up just run app.py

Pydantic was an entirely new library to me, but definitely one i'll be making more use of going forward. Very useful for validating data and giving strong error messaging. Given more time I would've liked to have dived deeper into the docs and written some custom error messages but I burned a lot of time learning these modules for this as my experience prior to it was with PostgreSQL and Django for the backend. 

Thanks!
